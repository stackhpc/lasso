-----------------------

Fixed support for SWIG 1.3.28 (now required), fixed a win32 build issue, fixed
documentation.

signatures to ID-WSF messages, added first draft of SAML 2 support (only
Web-SSO and part of Single Logout for the moment), fixed some corner cases,
improved error detection in different places, upgraded SWIG support to 1.3.28
and generally improved the bindings.

Improved behaviour when confronted to other Liberty providers that do not
implement all the mandatory Liberty requirements, improved error status code
reporting, completed support for public keys embedded in metadata files, fixed

0.6.2 - May 26th 2005
---------------------

Fixed usage of NameIdentifiers after calls to Register Name Identifier profile,

shipped with Microsoft Visual Studio project files.


0.6.0 - January 27th 2005
-------------------------

Rewrote library internals to use standard structures instead of libxml2 nodes;
this allows faster processing, more flexibility and better support for language
bindings.  Documented all the API functions.  Fixed and improved the rest.


0.5.0 - November 9th 2004
-------------------------

All features of SP Basic, SP, IDP, and LECP profiles for Liberty IDFF 1.2

with the demo application of the last Beta version of SourceID Liberty 2.0.

API, ABI, and dump format of messages have changed, so this release is not
compatible with previous versions.
