  Current homepage: <http://lasso.entrouvert.org>

Lasso (Liberty Alliance Single Sign-On) is a free (GNU GPL) implementation
of the Liberty Alliance specifications.  Those define processes for
federated identities, single sign-on and related protocols.  Lasso provides
both a C library and bindings for different languages.

The latest version of Lasso can be found on the labs.libre-entreprise.org
website, <http://labs.libre-entreprise.org/frs/?group_id=31>


Lasso has several mailing lists:

- lasso-devel@lists.labs.libre-entreprise.org

  The mailing list for Lasso users and developers; discussions about both
  development and deployment of Lasso have their place on this list.

  <http://lists.labs.libre-entreprise.org/mailman/listinfo/lasso-devel>

- lasso-cvs-commits@lists.labs.libre-entreprise.org

  This list just distributes notices about commits to the Lasso CVS tree.
  It has no discussions, and it is not interesting unless you wish to
  take part in development.

There is also a bug tracking system on the labs.libre-entreprise.org website,
  <http://labs.libre-entreprise.org/tracker/?atid=206&group_id=31>


Lasso was originally written by Nicolas Clapiès and Valéry Febvre.  Please
see the file AUTHORS_ for a list of major contributors, and the ChangeLog
for a detailed listing of all contributions.
